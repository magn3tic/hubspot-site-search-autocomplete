# Hubspot Site Search Autocomplete

An auto-completing search bar for use with [hubspot site search](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/site-search).  This is the repository for the jQuery plugin version, which can be embedded and used on any webpage.  

If you are trying to use this inside the Hubspot template builder, check out the [Hubspot Search COS Module documentation](https://magn3tic.github.io/hubspot-site-search-autocomplete/hubspot-cos-module.html).  The Hubspot COS module allows content-managers to configure search to *work* and *look* the way they want without writing code.
